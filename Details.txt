Next Session:

  removeEventListener -- events can only be removed with named callback function & addeventlistner should also have the named callback function

  options in eventListener:
    once: boolean value to tell whether event should execute only once

  2. Concepts in events

    Way of Propagation:

      2. Capturing (outer to inner) ---> event progation of events from outermost parent to innermost child

      stopProgation func for an event:
